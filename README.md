# MTT
Offline SRT Reader for Arduino

# What it can do
- read the SD card, grabs all files and sort
- places a cursor that can be moved up and down with push buttons as the
  first screen which is file selection
- pressing push button A goes through the subtitle file normally
- next and prev line in subtitles display mode
- Pause (resetting sleep timer) on subtitle line

# What I need to do next
- Ability to jump to any time in the subtitle file upon selecting it
- possible unicode font support for Japanese?
- Add line wrapping
- Properly render new lines instead of placing them side by side
